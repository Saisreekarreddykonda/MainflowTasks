# 💼 Data Science & Machine Learning Projects 
## 🚀 Project Overview 

This project is a collection of applied data science tasks aimed at solving real-world problems through end-to-end data analysis and machine learning. It covers diverse domains including education, e-commerce, real estate, customer behavior, and sentiment analysis. Across five major tasks, I worked on data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building using various machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, linear regression, K-Means clustering, and natural language processing (NLP). I used Python and libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and spaCy, all within a Jupyter/Google Colab environment.

## 📌 Task 1: Student Performance Analysis
- Dataset: `student-mat.csv`
- Performed initial EDA on student performance data.
- Investigated average grades, correlation between study time and performance, and gender-based comparisons.
- Visualizations: Histograms, scatter plots, and bar plots.
- Libraries: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

---

## 📌 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Datasets: `Global_Superstore2.csv`, `Sales Data.csv`
- Cleaned and preprocessed data (duplicates, outliers, missing values).
- Computed summary statistics: mean, median, variance, std dev.
- Visualized key insights using heatmaps, pie charts, bar graphs.
- Focused on global sales, profit distribution, and discount trends.

---

## 📌 Task 3: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
- Dataset: `Mall_Customers.csv`
- Applied K-Means clustering on standardized features (Age, Income, Spending Score).
- Used Elbow method and Silhouette score to determine optimal clusters.
- Visualized clusters using PCA and pair plots.
- Output: Segmented customer data with cluster labels for business insights.

---

## 📌 Task 4: Housing Price Prediction (Regression)
- Dataset: `Housing.csv`
- Preprocessing: MinMax and Standard scaling, label encoding, and one-hot encoding.
- Feature selection using correlation matrix.
- Model: Linear Regression.
- Output: R² score and RMSE to evaluate price prediction accuracy.

## 📌 Task 5: Pass/Fail Prediction & Sentiment Analysis
### 1. Student Pass Prediction
- Created a synthetic dataset with `Study Hours`, `Attendance`, and `Pass`.
- Trained a logistic regression model with 100% test accuracy on simple data.
- Visualized confusion matrix and interpreted model coefficients.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis on Reviews
- Dataset: `reviews.csv` (product reviews with sentiment labels)
- Text cleaning, lemmatization using spaCy.
- Model: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features.
- Achieved ~96% accuracy with strong F1 score.
- Output: Confusion matrix, classification report, and prediction insights.
