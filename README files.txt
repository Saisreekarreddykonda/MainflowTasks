### ✅ `README.md` (Final Upload Version)

You can copy this into a text editor (like Notepad), save it as `README.md`, and upload it to your GitHub repository.

## 🧩 Project Summary

### 📌 Task 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Visualizations: histograms, pair plots, box plots
- Key insights on age, annual income, and spending score

### 📌 Task 2 – Data Preprocessing
- Scaling numerical features using `StandardScaler`
- Handling missing or irrelevant values
- Preparing data for clustering

### 📌 Task 3 – Clustering Analysis
- K-Means clustering for customer segmentation
- Elbow Method to identify optimal cluster count
- Visualizing customer segments and centroid interpretation
